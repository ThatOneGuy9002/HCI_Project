            <p>Dear Class,

                I hope this message finds you well. Just a quick reminder that your "Biomes and Human Settlements" assignment is due this Friday. Please ensure that you’ve addressed the three biomes of your choice and analyzed their influence on human settlements, both historically and in modern times.
                As well as this, make sure to complete the homework form on the assignment page. From this I will be able to see your answers for the next lesson.
                
              </p>
            <p>A few points to remember:</p>
            <p>Be specific in your examples
                Include relevant maps and diagrams.
                Keep your analysis concise but detailed — quality over quantity!
            </p>
            <p>If you have any questions or need clarification, don’t hesitate to message me or visit during my office hours on Wednesday from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM.
            </p>
